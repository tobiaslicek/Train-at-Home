        <h2>30 Moves to Make the Most of Your At-Home Workout</h2>

          At-home fitness is more important now than ever. With more people
          working from home and practicing social distancing, keeping fit and
          staying active requires a unique approach — and one that's not as easy
          as just frequenting a local gym or fitness studio (of which are now
          closed). But while it's important to stay healthy right now, we
          understand that paying for a fitness service may seem non-essential to
          your monthly budget. Doling out monthly dues for a multi-level gym
          with free weights, treadmills, and access to personal trainers is one
          thing but ponying up the money for access to a streaming video in your
          living room may not seem as viable an option.

        <h2>Gym closed? Here are some of the best home workout options</h2>
        <img src="gymsclosed.png" alt="gyms closed" />
        <p>
          There are really only two ways I'm coming out of this self-quarantine:
          super-ripped or in dire need of a diet. As the coronavirus outbreak
          leaves millions of people hunkered down at home and state-wide
          lockdown orders close all nonessential businesses, many of us are left
          without access to our usual gyms, workout studios and even parks.
          Switching to a home workout routine isn't easy -- it takes some space
          and a lot of intrinsic motivation -- but in light of the COVID-19
          outbreak, many fitness experts, gyms, apps and studios are doing their
          part to help us stay in shape. And establishing a workout routine
          could, most importantly, ease anxiety related to coping with the
          pandemic.
